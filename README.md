## Abstract
Condensed matter physics investigates the collective behavior of matter at the macroscopic scale, arising from interactions among numerous microscopic particles. 
The Klein-Gordon equation, a relativistic wave equation applicable to massive particles, finds relevance in describing certain condensed matter systems. 
However, analytical solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation often pose challenges, especially for complex systems. This work explores the utilization of neural networks 
for computational modeling of the Klein-Gordon equation in condensed matter physics. We introduce a framework where neural networks are trained to predict energy 
levels or other system properties directly from the system's parameters.
